            I'm a recent bootcamp graduate with a lifelong passion for coding. I
            began experimenting with programming at a young age and have since
            honed my skills in building applications of all sizes. Whether
            working independently or as part of a team.

            I'm a recent graduate from a bootcamp where I learned the necessary
            skills to become a full-stack software developer. My interest in
            coding started when I was just 12 years old, experimenting with
            replicating the functionalities of the games I played, building a
            range of mobile projects that allowed me to see the results of my
            work firsthand.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm self-driven and self-taught, which is evident in the way I
            learned English to access more resources related to coding. After
            graduating from high school in Brazil in 2021, I moved to London to
            seek out new opportunities to further my development career.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a junior software developer, I bring strong coding skills and a
            passion for self-improvement to the table. I enjoy both independent
            and collaborative work, and I'm always eager to stay up-to-date with
            the latest trends and advancements in the field. I believe I can be
            a valuable asset to any team looking for a driven, enthusiastic
            developer.
