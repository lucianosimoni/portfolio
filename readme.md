1. Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the React application.

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Start the application locally.

```bash
npm run start # Starts the local server at port 3000
```

## 🚀 Run the built locally app

If you want to run the built version locally (the same that will be on all browsers), do the following

```bash
# Run Built project locally - "-g" installs it globally on your machine
npm i spa-http-server -g
# cd to the dist folder, then:
http-server --push-state
```
